# Scribe_the_PA
This is the algorithm/partial code for my personal assistant program names "Scribe"
To use this code to its fullest potential, you need to get the following files and API and links:
1. A weather information gathering API along with the base link
2. A google CSE api along with the credential file. 
3. All the necessary python libraries and modules that are imported into the code.
4. A Google calendar API and its credentials.

to install the required libraries, run this command in your terminal "pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 google-api-python-client requests nltk plyer"
Replace all the placeholder API, links and file paths to credential files in the code and run it.

Default calling keyword for the assistant is "Scribe". but you can change it and replace it as needed.
